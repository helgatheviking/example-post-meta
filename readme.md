# Example Post Meta #

Example plugin code source from my [tutorial](https://www.kathyisawesome.com/add-a-meta-field-to-the-block-editor-sidebar/). 

![A screenshot of the WordPress post editor. In the right sidebar there's a red square highlighting an area titled "Your Meta Field" and directly beneath it there's a text input with the value "It's pizza friday yay"](https://github.com/helgatheviking/example-post-meta/assets/507025/7ffd6e16-a937-4471-9ae4-498adb66671f)

It adds a text input to the WordPress block editor sidebar and saves the data to post meta.
